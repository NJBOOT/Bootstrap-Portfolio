Building a portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework

This is a project focused on creating a mobile responsive layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. This means the site should render as aethetically pleasing and reader friendly regardless of the viewport (computer, tablet, phone, etc). Use of Bootstrap CSS generally allows one to bypass the use of Media Queries to accomplish this task since responsiveness is natively incorporated in the framework.
